# Control-of-Mobile-Robots
From Coursera - Control of Mobile Robots and Georgia Tech's Sim.I.am robot simulator, I was able to develop a mobile robot that successfully reaches any desired goal while avoiding any obstacle in its way,

The repository is divided by each week of the Control of Mobile Robots of Coursera. In each week folder, you will be the files associated with the tasks and lectures for that week. 

The goal of each week's project can be find under the "Week # Project." Note that this doesn't apply to Week 1 where only an introduction to the Sim.I.am simulator is shown. 

In order to run the code, you will need the following:
-An active MATLAB license
-Have the GUI Layout Toolbox 2.3.2.mltbx installed in MATLAB
-Have the "simiam-simiam-coursera-week-#" folder downloaded it in your computer (redownload for each week).

Once all the aforementioned requirements are set, to run the code simply open the "launch" code or type in the MATLAB commdan window.
